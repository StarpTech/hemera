## Quality of Service

At Most Once Delivery (TCP reliability) - In the basic NATS platform, if a subscriber is not listening on the subject (no subject match), or is not active when the message is sent, the message is not received. NATS is a fire-and-forget messaging system. If you need higher levels of service, you can either use NATS Streaming, or build the additional reliability into your client(s) yourself.
